<h2>How I maintain a modicum of sanity:</h2>
<p>By day, I'm a Product Manager and Web Developer. By night, I'm a screenwriter focusing on TV scripts, pilots, screenplays, and sketches. When I'm not playing my guitar or building spreadsheets, I love to write jokes on Twitter where you can find me as <a href="https://twitter.com/GCGeek" target="_blank">@GCGeek</a> or on Spoutible as <a href="https://spoutible.com/GCGeek" target="_blank">@GCGeek</a>.</p>
<p>You can always find more information and my creative works on my personal <a href="https://mikemorucci.com"  target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
